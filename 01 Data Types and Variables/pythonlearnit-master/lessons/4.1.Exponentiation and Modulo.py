# Integer arithmetic special operations

# Exponentiation Operations
# base ** exponent
print(2 ** 3)  # Two to the power of three
print(5 ** 2)
print(10 ** 4)
print(3 ** 5)
print(2 ** 10)

# Modulo Operations
# divident % devisor
print(10 % 3)  # This is the remainder when ten is divided by 3
print(15 % 4)
print(17 % 5)
print(24 % 7)
print(100 % 30)

# The Power-Modulo Challenge
# Calculate 3 to the power of 4, then find the remainder when devided by 5
result = (3 ** 4) % 5  # we calculate 3^4, which is 81, and we find 81%5, which is 1
print(result)
#print(3 ** 4)
