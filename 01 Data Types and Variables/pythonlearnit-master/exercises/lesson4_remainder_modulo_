# 2. Decode the Secret Message
# You've just intercepted an encoded message . 
# The message is a string of numbers, but you know their 
# encryption method: each letter of the alphabet is represented by its 
# position (hint1: A=0, B=1, C=2...Z=27; hint2: use chr()), and these numbers are then 
# concatenated into one long string. You need to decode the last 
# letter of this secret message. 

# 1. Extract the last digit of the encoded message.
# 2. Use this to determine the correstponding letter. 
# 3. Report back with the decoded letter.
